# CS3658-HPC-Project---Hangman-

Our project is based on implemeting hangman using parallelization and using different methods of achieving the parallisation.
We first used hangman and hangman parallel where multiple games were implemented in parallel the difference being the emphasis on pratical execution.(hangman.py and hangparallel.py)
Then we used letter based method of parallelization (hangletter.py)
And then implement it again using mpi (hanglettermpi.py,hangtextmpi.py)

More details are the in the ppt uploaded here.
